- Introduce daily routine ( Will repeat to be familiar ) 
  I usually wake up around 5:30 to 6 AM. Then I take a walk around 3 miles. It usually take a hour.
  During the summer, I walk around the park next to our community. During the winter, I just walk around our neightbor.
  After walk, I return to my house and take a shower. Then enjoy breakfast with my family.
  After breakfast, I walk with Claire to the bus stop then watch some news until 9 o'clock.
  I start work at 9 and take a lunch break at noon. Jaehyun and I enjoy lunch together and watch news.
  I go back to work at 1 o'clock and finish about 5 ~ 6 PM.
  After finish my work, we try to eat dinner together.
  After dinner, we watch TV or I read industrial book.
  Claire go to bed at 9 o'clock then I enjoy my own time. Sometime I read books , sometime watch some TV show.
  I usually go to bet at midnight.
